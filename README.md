*Construction of the website is well under way!*

This page houses the files for the website as it is under development. As changes are made, they will be periodically updated here, where they can be accessed and reviewed.

The general plan for the website is outlined below, in the Roadmap. Plans for features are arranged into a list of checkboxes, which will become filled as that milestone is achieved.

> [!Note]
> Right now, the project does not have images, however this will change after the next update. A cleaning process will be applied to the product images, then beautiful scenes can be constructed. The framework is in place to allow a change in theme on each page, though at the moment they use the same scheme.

> [!Important]
> Under the **About** section on the right of the screen, press **Activity** (Next to the Graph icon) to see progress and changes made. On mobile devices, this is along the top of the screen.

> [!Warning]
> Sometimes, such as just after an update or viewing multiple times in a row, the Preview for the website may encounter an error. This is temporary and usually fixed by refreshing or restarting.

- [ ] Showcase products individually (Images and descriptions)

> *Due to the revolving nature of inventory, stones are show as examples of the products available at the store. These sub-pages should feature as many images of the current inventory as possible.
